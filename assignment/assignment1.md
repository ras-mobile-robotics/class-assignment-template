## 1. Mathematical Formulas
The probability density function of a Gaussian distribution is defined as:

$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$

Where:
- $$\mu$$ is the mean (peak location).
- $$\sigma$$ is the standard deviation (width of the "bell").

## 2. Code Implementation

Below is a snippet of the Python code used to process the assignment data.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_velocity(displacement, time):
    """Calculates average velocity."""
    return np.divide(displacement, time)

print(f"Result: {calculate_velocity(100, 20)} m/s")

```
